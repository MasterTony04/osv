======================

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This program intends to work as a driver to decode the OSV's BMS serial protocol
and to provide the BMS's data in files. The files are placed in "/tmp/osv-bms".

The protocol specification is available at
<https://github.com/telecombretagne/osv/blob/master/bms_reverse/bms_reverse.html>.
Not all the data has been decoded yet, so some information may be missing (such
as warning and error status…).

HOW TO
------

Make sure that the BMS is plugged-in and that the CDC_ACM driver has detected
it.
Make the script "osv-bms-data-driver.pl" executable and run it.

The path where the data is displayed can be set by modifying the value of the
"$pathToBmsFiles" variable in the script.

DEPENDANCIES
------------

The kernel driver for CDC ACM devices. On a Debian like system run:
$ sudo apt-get install acm

Perl, and the "Device::SerialPort" Perl module.
