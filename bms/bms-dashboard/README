DESCRIPTION
-----------

This program can be used to display the information of the OSV's BMS, using
the "osv-bms-data-driver.pl" script. It is a simple graphical application, just
showing the data.

The protocol specification is available at
<https://github.com/telecombretagne/osv/blob/master/bms_reverse/bms_reverse.html>.
Not all the data has been decoded yet, so some information may be missing (such
as warning and error status…).

HOW TO
------

This is a Maven project. Compile with:
$ mvn package

at the root of the project (where this file is).

Make sure the osv-bms-data-driver.pl script is running before starting this
program. Maven makes an executable jar file. It can be run with:
$ java -jar target/OSV-BMS-dashboard-{$VERSION}.jar

If the path to the BMS's data files is not the default one (i.e.
"/tmp/osv-bms/"), it can be set by using the File → Options menu.

DEPENDANCIES
------------

Java, a JDK, and Maven should be enough. On a Debian like system, these can be
installed with:
$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk maven2

Also, the osv-bms-data-driver.pl script is required and must be running for this
program to work.
